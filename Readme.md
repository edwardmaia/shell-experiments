# Shell Experiments - Learning Project

This project is part of my learning journey, inspired by the [Build Your Own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) collection.

The implementation is written in C and based on online tutorials, with custom modifications and comments added to reinforce my understanding.
